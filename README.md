### Summary

Dragon-GPT is an AI-powered tool that automatically does the threat modeling analysis on the diagram made using the OWASP Threat Dragon modeling software. It uses the OpenAI API, so you need to have a valid account for their tokens to use on each program call, and the JSON file generated when you save/export an OWASP Threat Dragon project (generally saved in td.vue folder).

The program itself is pretty simple, it extracts every relevant information on the JSON file, like the diagram model and components used on the modeling, and transforms it into a human-readable sentence. After that, the sentence is send via OpenAI API, and the result of the analysis is printed. By default, it uses `chatgpt-3.5-turbo` but you can change that via parameter to another model like the `chatgpt-4`.

### Usage:
```
usage: main.py [-h] [--api_key API_KEY] [--model MODEL] [--output OUTPUT] filename

Dragon-GPT is a CLI program that makes an automatic threat analysis using Chat-GPT on a given scenario produced using OWASP Threat Dragon.

positional arguments:
  filename              Path to the diagram (json format excepted)

options:
  -h, --help                      show this help message and exit
  --api_key API_KEY, -k API_KEY   Pass the key as parameter or set it on .env file
  --model MODEL, -m MODEL         OpenAI Model to be used by OpenAI API (default: gpt-3.5-turbo)
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT      Export the response from openai to a txt file
```
